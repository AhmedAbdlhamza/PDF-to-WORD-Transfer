# PDF-to-WORD-Transfer
I can provide you with a sample Python script that can help you convert PDF to Word using PyPDF2 and python-docx libraries.

Before you proceed, make sure to install these libraries using pip command.

pip install PyPDF2

pip install python-docx

After installing these libraries, follow the below steps to convert the PDF file to Word file.

# Step 1: Import the necessary libraries

python
Copy code
import PyPDF2
from docx import Document


# Step 2: Open the PDF file using PyPDF2
pdf_file = open('input_file.pdf', 'rb')
pdf_reader = PyPDF2.PdfFileReader(pdf_file)


# Step 3: Create a Word document object
doc = Document()

# Step 4: Loop through each page of the PDF file and extract the text
for page_num in range(pdf_reader.numPages):
    page = pdf_reader.getPage(page_num)
    text = page.extractText()
    
# Step 5: Add the extracted text to the Word document object
doc.add_paragraph(text)

# Step 6: Save the Word document
doc.save('output_file.docx')
That's it! You have successfully converted the PDF file to Word file format using Python. You can now use the output file for your analysis.
